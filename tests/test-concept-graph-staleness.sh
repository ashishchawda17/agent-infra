#
# /brain:save step 5c gated the wiki concept-graph refresh on notes changed THIS
# session only; staleness accumulated across prior sessions was invisible. A
# recorded incident: 2 session-changed notes, concept graph 517 documents behind,
# step reported green. The guard measures the TOTAL — wiki notes added/modified
# since the last commit that touched graphify-out/graph.json — from git, never
# from manifest.json (INNOV-271: it over-reports hundreds when ten changed).
#
# Contract under test:
#   exit 0 + first line "CONCEPT-GRAPH: OK - N document(s) ..."  (stdout) when
#            N <= threshold (default 25, CONCEPT_GRAPH_THRESHOLD overrides)
#   exit 1 + first line "CONCEPT-GRAPH: STALE - N document(s) behind" (stderr)
#            when N > threshold — WARN polarity, the caller relays but proceeds
#   exit 0 + "CONCEPT-GRAPH: SKIPPED - ..." when not measurable: no graph.json,
#            not a git repo, or graph.json never committed. Never a crash.
