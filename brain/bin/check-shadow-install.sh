#!/usr/bin/env bash
# check-shadow-install.sh — is more than one brain-family plugin live here?
# (INNOV-318, /brain:doctor check 12)
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Different plugin names are different plugins to Claude Code,
# and the same name at two scopes is two installs — nothing stops either, and
# nothing reported it. Both copies bind the same vault ($BRAIN_ROOT), so two sets
# of hooks fire and two `/…:save` commands write the same hot.md. SPO-324 cost a
# day this way: "the 0.2.34 fix doesn't work" was a stale PROJECT-scoped install
# shadowing a current USER-scoped one — three versions live at once, no warning.
# The tray-brain -> brain migration makes the same state for anyone who installs
# before uninstalling. The check is deliberately general ("more than one"), not
# migration-specific, so it stays useful after the migration is over.
#
# WHAT COUNTS AS LIVE for the project (CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR, else cwd):
#   - installed_plugins.json records: scope "user" everywhere; scope
#     "project"/"local" only when the record's projectPath is this project;
#   - enabledPlugins === true in user ~/.claude/settings.json, the project's
#     .claude/settings.json, or its .claude/settings.local.json;
#   minus any key set enabledPlugins === false at that same scope.
# One entry per (key, scope). The marketplace cache is a VERSION source for a
# settings-only entry, never an install source — a leftover cache dir alone is
# not live. A project/local record with no projectPath is counted and flagged
# rather than dropped: a false ❌ costs a look, a false ✅ cost SPO-324.
#
# Brain-family: the plugin name is `brain` or ends in `-brain`, or its install
# carries bin/vault-commit.sh (the vault commit path only a brain ships).
#
# Contract (the /brain:doctor skill and its tests depend on exactly this):
#   exit 0  => at most one brain-family install is live (OK), or undeterminable (SKIPPED)
#   exit 1  => SHADOWED — two or more are live; each is named with version,
#              scope, and the exact uninstall command. Nothing is uninstalled.
# First line: "SHADOW-INSTALL: OK" / "SHADOW-INSTALL: SKIPPED" (stdout) or
# "SHADOW-INSTALL: SHADOWED" (stderr).
# Under any verdict node can reach, a "STALE-MARKETPLACE: WARN" advisory (stdout) names each
# registered brain-family marketplace no live install comes from, when more than
# one is registered (INNOV-336). Registered = known_marketplaces.json or
# extraKnownMarketplaces; brain-family = its clone lists a brain-family plugin,
# else its name. Inert, so it never changes the exit code.
