#!/usr/bin/env bash
# changed-wiki-notes.sh — list the wiki/ notes that ACTUALLY changed, per git.
#
# /brain:save step 5c refreshes the wiki concept graph by dispatching one subagent
# per changed note. Deciding "changed" from graphify's manifest.json massively
# over-reports (a recorded incident flagged 375 wiki files when 10 had really
# changed — ~16 wasted subagents on a routine save), so this script asks git
# instead: uncommitted changes (staged + unstaged) plus, with --since, everything
# that moved between <ref> and HEAD. That workaround was a documented vault gotcha;
# this is the enforcement.
#
# The VAULT is resolved from $BRAIN_ROOT (this plugin's neutral contract var),
# falling back to $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR then the current dir — the script lives in the
# plugin, NOT inside the vault, so it cannot derive the vault from its own location.
#
# Read-only: no fetch, no add, no commit, no checkout. Nothing changed (or not a git
# repo) is a clean no-op — empty stdout, exit 0 — so a save never crashes on it.
#
# Usage:
#   BRAIN_ROOT=<vault> bash changed-wiki-notes.sh              # uncommitted changes only
#   bash changed-wiki-notes.sh --since <ref>                   # + everything since <ref>
#   bash changed-wiki-notes.sh --porcelain                     # count on line 1, then paths
#   bash changed-wiki-notes.sh --deleted [--since <ref>]       # deleted notes instead
#
# Prints one vault-relative wiki/**/*.md path per line, sorted and de-duplicated.
# Default: added and modified files only — deletions are excluded (nothing left to
# re-extract; this is /brain:save 5c's work list, one subagent per path).
# --deleted: the other stream (INNOV-292) — only notes deleted relative to HEAD (or
# <ref>) and absent on disk. check-concept-graph.sh sums both streams, since a
# deleted note leaves a phantom node in the graph. The two streams never overlap:
# a rename is its new path in the default stream and never a deletion here.
