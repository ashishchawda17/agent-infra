#!/usr/bin/env bash
# check-mirror-source.sh — is each vault mirror's source checkout able to feed it?
# (INNOV-338, /brain:doctor check 6)
#
# sync-graph.sh builds <vault>/graphify/<name>/ by COPYING
# <checkout>/graphify-out/graph.json. It is never built vault-side. A checkout
# with no local graph has nothing to copy, so sync skips the mirror and the
# vault's view of that repo freezes at its last copy — silently. graphify-out/
# is not in git, so every fresh clone of a mirrored repo lands in exactly this
# state. Doctor used to call a missing local graph "optional" everywhere; it is
# only optional in a checkout that feeds no mirror.
#
# The mirror -> checkout lookup is sync-graph.sh's, deliberately: the alias map
# from `resolve-repos.mjs --print-paths` (repos.json + repos.local.json), else the
# flat `$REPOS_DIR/<name>` fallback. A check that disagreed with sync about where
# a mirror's source lives would warn about mirrors sync feeds fine, or miss the
# ones it cannot. The resolved path already includes any subPath, and that is
# where sync looks for graphify-out/ — so this looks there too.
#
# Usage:
#   BRAIN_ROOT=<vault> bash check-mirror-source.sh              # every mirror
#   BRAIN_ROOT=<vault> bash check-mirror-source.sh <name>...    # just these
#   BRAIN_ROOT=<vault> bash check-mirror-source.sh --checkout <dir>
#       # which mirror does <dir> feed? (doctor passes the cwd). Matched by PATH,
#       # not by remote: a second clone of a mirrored repo feeds nothing unless it
#       # is the checkout the resolver picked.
#   BRAIN_ROOT=<vault> bash check-mirror-source.sh --behind [<name>...]
#       # how far is each PUBLISHED mirror behind its reference branch? (INNOV-354,
#       # doctor check 6b). Reads built_at_commit from the VAULT's
#       # graphify/<name>/graph.json and counts, in the source checkout,
#       #   git rev-list --count <built_at_commit>..origin/<branch> -- .
#       # <branch> is repos.json's "branch", else the checkout's detected default:
#       # lib/provenance.sh, the same rule sync-graph.sh's publish gate applies.
#       # `-- .` runs from the resolved path, so a subPath mirror counts only the
#       # commits under its own root; without a subPath it is the whole repo.
#       # Never fetches: it measures what the checkout last fetched.
#
# Contract — ONE line per mirror on stdout; the FIRST TOKEN is the verdict:
#   OK <name> <path>          source has graphify-out/graph.json
#   NO-GRAPH <name> <path>    source exists but has no graph: mirror is FROZEN
#   UNRESOLVED <name>         no source checkout found on this machine
#   NO-MIRROR <name>          a named mirror that has no graphify/<name>/ folder
#   UNMIRRORED <dir>          (--checkout) <dir> feeds no mirror: a local graph
#                             is optional there (only the cwd query hook uses it)
#   SKIPPED - <reason>        not measurable (no vault / no graphify/ / no node)
# --behind lines:
#   CURRENT <name> - ...      built at the reference branch's tip (0 behind)
#   BEHIND <name> - ...       N commit(s) behind origin/<branch>
#   OFF-BRANCH <name> - ...   build commit is not on origin/<branch> at all
#   SKIPPED <name> - <reason> unverifiable (no checkout, no/unknown commit, no
#                             origin ref, shallow clone): never fails doctor
# exit 1 => at least one NO-GRAPH (or BEHIND / OFF-BRANCH) line. exit 0 otherwise. WARN polarity: doctor
# relays the line, nothing is blocked. Read-only: the resolver cache is never
# written (--print-paths without --write).
